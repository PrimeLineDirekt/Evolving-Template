# Evolving for Beginners

A step-by-step guide for AI newcomers.

## What is Evolving?

Imagine having a super-intelligent assistant that:
- **Remembers everything** you tell it
- **Finds connections** between your ideas
- **Thinks with you** when you need help

That's Evolving - your personal knowledge system.

## Glossary: Terms Explained

| Term | Simple Explanation |
|------|-------------------|
| **Command** | An instruction starting with `/` (e.g., `/idea-new`) |
| **Agent** | An AI expert for a specific topic |
| **Skill** | A specialized AI capability |
| **Knowledge Base** | Your personal knowledge collection |
| **Sparring** | Brainstorming with the AI |
| **Onboarding** | The process of setting up your profile |

## Day 1: First Steps

### Step 1: Complete Onboarding (5 min)

1. Open the file `_ONBOARDING.md`
2. Fill in at least:
   - Your name/pseudonym
   - What drives you (1-2 sentences)
   - 2-3 interests
3. Say: `Process the onboarding`

**Tip:** You don't need to fill everything! The minimum is enough to start.

### Step 2: Capture Your First Idea (2 min)

Simply say:
```
I have an idea: A tool that helps me organize my tasks
```

The AI will:
- Analyze your idea
- Assign a potential score
- Ask questions to refine the idea

### Step 3: Explore the System (3 min)

Try these commands:
- `Show me my ideas` - Overview of your ideas
- `/system-health` - System status

---

## Week 1: Getting Comfortable

### Daily Routine (5-10 min)

**Morning:**
- Capture new ideas when you have them
- Think about a topic with `/sparring`

**Evening:**
- Save learnings with `/knowledge-add`
- "Today I learned that..."

### The Most Important Commands

| What do you want? | Say... |
|------------------|--------|
| Capture idea | "I have an idea: ..." |
| Brainstorm | "/sparring" or "Let's brainstorm about..." |
| Save knowledge | "/knowledge-add" or "I learned that..." |
| View ideas | "Show me my ideas" |

### Using the Inbox

The easiest way to get files into the system:
1. Put files in the `_inbox/` folder
2. Say: `Process the inbox`
3. The AI categorizes and saves everything automatically

## Week 2+: Advanced Usage

When you're ready for more:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/idea-work` | Work intensively on an idea |
| `/idea-connect` | Find connections between ideas |
| `/project-add` | Document a project |
| `/knowledge-search` | Search your knowledge |

## FAQ: Common Questions

### "Do I have to use commands with /?"
No! You can also write normally. The AI recognizes your intent and asks if it should use the appropriate command.

### "What if I make a mistake?"
No problem! Just say what went wrong. The AI helps you correct it.

### "How do I delete an idea?"
Say: "Delete idea [name or number]"

### "Can I use the system in German?"
Yes! Just write in German - the AI responds in whatever language you write in.

## Getting Help

**If you have problems:**
- Just ask: "How does X work?"
- Use `/system-health` for diagnostics
- Read `START.md` for all details

**Give feedback:**
The system evolves with you. Share what you like and what could be better!

## Next Steps

1. **Now:** Complete onboarding
2. **Today:** Capture first idea
3. **This week:** Spend 5 min daily with the system
4. **Next week:** Try advanced commands

**Good luck!**
