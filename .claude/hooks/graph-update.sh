# Graph Update Hook
# Trigger: PostToolUse (Write, Edit)
# Purpose: Update Knowledge Graph when entities change

# This hook is a placeholder for future automation.
# Currently, the graph should be regenerated manually when significant
# changes are made to the system.
#
# Future implementation could:
# 1. Detect which file was changed
# 2. Parse the file for frontmatter
# 3. Update the corresponding node in nodes.json
# 4. Recalculate affected edges
# 5. Update index files
#
# For now, use the following command to regenerate:
# "Regeneriere den Knowledge Graph" or "/graph-rebuild"

# Exit successfully (hook is informational only)
exit 0
