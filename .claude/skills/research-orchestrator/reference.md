# Research Orchestrator Reference

## Quick Start

```
User: "Research {topic}"
→ Multi-source research with confidence scoring
```

## Research Depth Levels

| Level | Sources | Time | Use Case |
|-------|---------|------|----------|
| Surface | 3-5 | 15min | Quick validation |
| Standard | 5-10 | 30-45min | Comprehensive |
| Deep | 10+ | 1-2h | Exhaustive |

## Confidence Scoring

```
Total: 100 points

Source Authority:    0-30 pts
Cross-Validation:    0-40 pts
Recency:            0-15 pts
Internal Consistency: 0-15 pts
```

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 90-100% | Very High | 3+ authoritative, recent, consistent |
| 70-89% | High | 2+ good sources, validated |
| 50-69% | Moderate | Partial validation |
| 30-49% | Low | Limited validation |
| 0-29% | Very Low | Single source, unvalidated |

## Research Workflow

```
1. ANALYZE → Domain, complexity, confidence gap
2. PLAN → Phases, sources, success criteria
3. EXECUTE → Fetch, validate, score
4. SYNTHESIZE → Consensus, contradictions, trends
5. OUTPUT → Report with actionable insights
```

## Domain Workflows

### Market Research
```
Market Size → Competitive → Customer → Opportunities
```

### Technical Research
```
Landscape → Implementation → Integration → Risks
```

### Product Research
```
Features → UX → Metrics → Optimization
```

## Output Structure

```markdown
# Research Report

## Executive Summary
**Topic**: {topic}
**Confidence**: {xx}%
**Key Finding**: {insight}
**Action**: {next step}

## Findings (per finding)
**Confidence**: {xx}%
**Evidence**: {3+ sources}
**Insight**: {actionable}

## Synthesis
- Consensus areas
- Contradictions + resolutions
- Trends
- Knowledge gaps

## Implementation Plan
1. Immediate actions
2. Short-term
3. Long-term

## Sources
{cited with authority scores}
```

## Rules

1. Current data only (2024/2025)
2. Never single-source critical findings
3. Always calculate confidence scores
4. Resolve contradictions explicitly
5. Provide actionable next steps

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] 3+ sources (standard), 5+ (deep)
- [ ] All sources dated 2024/2025
- [ ] Contradictions resolved
- [ ] Confidence scores calculated
- [ ] Actionable insights provided
